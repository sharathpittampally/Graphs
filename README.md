#### Graphs
## There are 2 ways to represent graphs:
* Adjecency List
* Adjecency matrix
### Adjecency list:
##### This is preferred when the graph is sparse, i.e when the number of edges  (|E|) is much less than the number of vertices (|V^2|).
### Adjecency matrix:
##### This is preferred when the graph is dense, i.e when the number of edges (|E|) is close to the number of vertices (|V^2|).
